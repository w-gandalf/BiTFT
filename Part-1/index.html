<center><h3>The Fairy Tales of BitFT: Part 1, where wizard Gandalf came to fix and do magic</h3></center>
		<p><strong>W.Blake</strong>: Greetings, master Gandalf!<br>

<strong>w.Gandalf</strong>: Ages, William Blake, ages.<br>

<strong>W.Blake</strong>: Why are you here now?<br>

<strong>w.Gandalf</strong>: To fix and do magic, my friend. <br>

<strong>W. Blake</strong>: What is BitFT?<br>

<strong>w.Gandalf</strong>: BitFT is a standard, most primitive <a style="color:white" href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xb8c408ef0229c79941c720e1dbddc9181d73a6bf" target="_blank">ERC-20 token that exist in Ethereum blockchain</a>, with only one basic function - transfer.<br>

<strong>W. Blake</strong>: What is the purpose of BitFT?<br>

<strong>w.Gandalf</strong>: It is a transition token with a supply of 26308 BitFT. No other BitFT than 26308 may be produced. One day of the Spring, one who have a key with BitFT will be able to transit 10 times equal amount (1:10) to a new blockchain, and be a only part of Coins of Genesis in the new blockchain. New blockchain will be running on Substrate 2.0 (Polkadot) engine, with all magic, and power, and modularity of it. <br>

<strong>W.Blake</strong>: Master Gandalf, very interesting, please, tell me more, who hold the keys?<br>

<strong>w.Gandalf</strong>: Magic drop occurred. Thousands of blocks and transactions were programmatically scanned for own snapshot, only Infura worked as a node provider for the purpose :p, no doings of Humpty Dumpty and All the King’s horses and all the King’s men were or will be ever touched. Key holders were magically filtered by future expectations in some moment of time in the past. Maybe a snapshot of expectations. 1398 keys.  <br>

<strong>w.Blake</strong>: But can a key holders make transactions?<br>

<strong>w.Gandalf</strong>: Of course they can make transactions, as a transfer type of transaction is the only thing why BitFT exist before using it as a ticket for transit to Substrate 2.0 of Polkadot, some day of the Spring. Any key, including any new key, who will have any BiTFT - will be able to use is as a ticket for transit. 1 BitFT to 10 coins. 1:10. <br>

<strong>W.Blake</strong>: What is a value of BitFT than?<br>

<strong>w.Gandalf</strong>: 0. Nothing. Zero. BitFT has no material value at the moment of magic drop, and it will have no value until anyone will assign some value to it and other will agree with it. When this will happen, and the value will be assigned, it also will be possible to transfer this value from one to another with that primitive and only transfer function of BiTFT. However, at the moment of magic drop much more significant thing happened - non measurable and non material value was created, re created, transferred to 1398 key holders, of different ages, countries, cultures, views but equal expectations at some moment in the past. Value of the community which can provide immediate decentralization by default is far beyond any other valuations. Community value that comes with BiTFT is Infinite.<br>   

<strong>W.Blake</strong>: What about you master Gandalf?<br>

<strong>w.Gandalf</strong>: "I must create a system, or be enslaved by another man's. I will not reason and compare: my business is to create.", one man said - William Blake. One day I will go away to nowhere, as I came from there. Will not be needed. Decentralized blockchain should not, by definition, rely on any single developer person, or entity who provides software, or nodes, or block validator, or cartel of block validators and block relayers. And decentralization will win. Initial decentralization of BiTFT will allow new blockchain and new coins be decentralized since start, by default. Eventually, the most part of material value comes from secure networks and secure blockchains, starting from a primitive value transfer, expanding to VM with smart contracts execution, modular layers of privacy, modular non cryptocurrency functions of the network, like primitive file storage or chats, governance, every little thing that Substarte 2.0 of Polkadot allows to implement. But it all starts with basics and primitives, and the main is: decentralization. <br>

<strong>W.Blake</strong>: You promise?<br>

<strong>w.Gandalf</strong>: Nothing. This all is a Great Experiment of Magic. Anyone is free to participate or not to participate, go or join. It can fall, broke, cut, thrown away, but remember, it is starting from 0, zero, nothing of material value and it barely can go bellow zero. But promise to apply the wisdom, imagination and magic skills to make descibed happening, may fail, may fly, there are no promises, and no warranties: This all is Great Experiment of Magic.<br> 
  
<strong>W.Blake</strong>: Anything else master Gandalf?<br>

<strong>w.Gandalf</strong>: Yes, many thanks to master Cheong for ZEEDEX and <a style="color:white;" href ="https://eth.zeedex.io/trade/BITFT-USDT" target="_blank">BiTFT there</a>. <br>

<strong>W.Blake</strong>: Anything else master Gandalf?<br>

<strong>w.Gandalf</strong>: Yes, as always, as Alice, follow the white rabbit, when time comes, few times in a month.
